# Non-Linear-Regression-Analysis-with-Python





## Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

*   Differentiate between linear and non-linear regression
*   Use non-linear regression model in Python


If the data shows a curvy trend, then linear regression will not produce very accurate results when compared to a non-linear regression since linear regression presumes that the data is linear.
Let's learn about non linear regressions and apply an example in python. In this notebook, we fit a non-linear model to the datapoints corrensponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.
